# 📊 Data Science Job Market Analysis — Pivot Table & Pivot Chart Project

## 📘 Overview
This project showcases my **Excel PivotTable** and **PivotChart** proficiency using real-world-style job posting data for **data science roles**.  
The dataset contains job listings, salaries, skills, and posting dates.  

I performed four major analyses using PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and timelines to answer typical questions a **data science job seeker** might ask.

## 🧠 Scenario: “A Job Seeker Exploring the Data Science Market”
Imagine you’re an aspiring data scientist exploring job trends and salaries.  
You might ask:

1. 💰 **Which roles offer the highest average salaries?**  
2. 📊 **How are different levels of data professionals represented in the job market?**  
3. 📆 **How do job postings trend month by month? Are there hiring seasons?**

Each worksheet in this project answers one of these key questions.

## 🧮 Worksheet 3 — `%_of_GT` (Distribution of Data Nerds)
**Question:** What is the share of each group of data professionals in the job market?

**Grouping**
- **Data Nerds** — entry-level or mid-level data analysts  
- **Senior Data Nerds** — advanced professionals (e.g., senior analysts, data engineers, data scientists)  
- **Other Data Nerds** — business-related or hybrid data roles  

**Pivot Setup**
- **Rows:** Data Group (`Data Nerds`, `Senior Data Nerds`, `Other Data Nerds`)  
- **Values:** Count of Job Title → *Show Values As → % of Grand Total*  
- **Chart Type:** Doughnut Chart or 100% Stacked Column  

**Insights**
- **Data Nerds** make up the largest portion of postings, reflecting strong demand for analysts.  
- **Senior Data Nerds** account for a smaller share — fewer but higher-level roles.  
- **Other Data Nerds** represent hybrid business-data positions.  

**Excel Features Demonstrated**
✅ “Show Values As” → % of Grand Total  
✅ Slicers for dynamic category filtering  
✅ Category grouping and labeling within PivotTable
